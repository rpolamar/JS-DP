1 . <b>god object<b> In object-oriented programming, a god object (sometimes also called an omniscient or all-knowing object) is an object that references a large number of distinct types, has too many unrelated or uncategorized methods, or some combination of both. The god object is an example of an anti-pattern and a code smell.
